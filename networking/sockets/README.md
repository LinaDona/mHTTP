# Sockets
- A socket is a file in Unix-like systems.
- You will need a socket to talk to another process (okey yeah there are other ways for IPC ik) in the same machine or in some 28736362km far machine.
- An HTTP server/client is not the only thing that relies on sockets, peer-to-peer network apps also rely on them. They are everywhere fyi; `SOCKETS ARE EVERYWHERE`.
